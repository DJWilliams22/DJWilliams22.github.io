Howdy, my name is Jeff Golze and I am a Junior Technology Management Major. I am 21 years old and grew up in The Woodlands, TX. 

Before coming to A&M, I attended The Woodlands Highschool where I was a member of both the football team and the AFJROTC program. Throughout my highschool career I set my sights on attending Texas A&M University in College Station. I found an interest in Information Technology during my senior year of highschool and have enjoyed learning more about the feild ever since.

Some of my interests include camping, hiking and rafting. I enjoy pretty much any outdoor activity and I occasinally do small wood carvings in my spare time.

Here is some information about one of my favorite places I have ever hiked. [Crater Lake][Crater Lake]
