Hello! My name is Jacquelyn Novelli, Jackie for short. I am a double major in Technology Management and Human Resource Development and a double minor in Cyber Sercurity and Business. I hope to become a Recruiter or PR Representative for a technology based compnay. 

This was a super cool and simple group project but you learn alot of skills from it. I had some issues connecting to github but it was due to a spelling error. I love tech and IT but I am not the best when it comes to code/information systems. That is why I would rather go into the people side of tech rather than the software/hardware side. 

A little more information about me is that I love art, photography, and videography. I currently work for a marketing company on their production team. I make ads, graphics, logos, and animations for the majority of our clients. 

Check out my [website][website] and a few of my projects here.
