# **Hi, My Name's Joshua Wood**

## School and Work
I am a non-traditional student studying Technology Management. I'm 28 years old and currently work for the Division of IT as an Endpoint Technologies analyst. 

I currently serve as the primary administer for several endpoint management technologies for the Division. Some of these include ManageEngine's Desktop Central platform, the Beyond Trust Remote Support system (formerly called Bomgar), and Microsoft's Endpoint Manager (Intune). 

### Most of what I do falls into a couple different categories:  
* Supporting Division of IT Personell in their daily work
* Handling escalations for incidents, outages, or problems on my systems
* Updating and maintaining my applications
* Remediating compliance issues with Division of IT workstations


## Hobbies and Other Things
In addition to what I do for the Division, I also like to spend my time doing real estate in College Station. I own a couple properties and manage another independently. I also like to dabble in remodeling and minor rebuilding. When I'm not doing something productive, I am usually hanging out with my wife watching Bones or listening to books. I used to be big into gaming and building custom computers, but hardly have time for that anymore.
