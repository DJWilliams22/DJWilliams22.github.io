Howdy, my name is Donald Williams and I am a senior Technology Management Major. I am from Ennis, Texas and I am just 21 years young. 

This was a really interesting project deploying this blog post, and I enjoyed working with GitHub as well as the VS Code Editor. I am hoping to continue working and get a job in Cybersecurity one day. First though, I would love to get my masters in information science or Cybersecurity, hopefully here at Texas A&M.

Brady won his 7th ring on Sunday. I was rooting for the Buccaneers and Brady, but I was hoping Mahommes and the Chiefs would have given them a much closer game. The final score was 31-9. Either way, Brady is the GOAT!
